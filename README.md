Additionally, there are some documents that could help in [0-Prerequisites](https://github.com/signumsoftware/docs/tree/master/0-Prerequisites) folder.

## Tutorials

In this folder there are docx files that explain the architecture of a Signum Framework application, like [Southwind](https://github.com/signumsoftware/southwind) or any [clone](http://www.signumsoftware.com/en/DuplicateApplication).

The documents are meant to give an overview of the different projects/modules and should be followed in order. They pretend to create a new application (Southwind) as a greenfield project but loading data from another database (Northwind).
